= Notes for Introduction to SQLAlchemy

* SQLAlchemy abstracts away the code from the DB and SQL peculiarities

* There are two modes of use

** SQL Expression Language "The Core"
** ORM

* Those modes may be used together or separately

* *SQLAlchemy Core* provides a tiny abstraction over SQL statements and expressions
** It is also the foundation for the ORM
** More schema-centric
** Best for data warehousing, reporting and other scenarios where tight control
   of queries and dealing with unmodeled data is useful

* *SQLAlchemy ORM* is a full-fledged ORM
** It follows an active-record style
** Has a more business-driven view, a domain-drive design of sorts
** Best when you want to encapsulate the schema in a way that feels like 'regular'
   Python code

* Remember: you can use both at the same time!
