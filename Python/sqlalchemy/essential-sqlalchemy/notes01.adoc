= Core - Schema and Types

* There are 4 categories of types we can use
* 1. Generics
* 2. SQL Standard
* 3. Vendor Specific
* 4. User Defined

== Generic Types

* SQL Alchemy abstracts away a lot of types

* https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/type_basics.html#generic-types[List of Generic Types]

* Those types will be _translated_ to the SQL type that's best available for
  a specific backend

* For example, some DBs don't have a `+boolean+` type but a `+small int+`, so
  SQLAlchemy will use `small int` while giving back a `boolean` to the Python
  code

== SQL Standard & Multiple Vendors

* https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/type_basics.html#sql-standard-and-multiple-vendor-types[List]

* Those types will be used AS IS. That is, if you define that a column has a type
  that is on this list, the `CREATE TABLE` statement that will be issued and
  everything else will have the *exact same type* as written in the code

TIP: The name of those types are ALL CAPS, to draw a difference from the Generics

IMPORTANT: Those types allow you to use the full power of some specific types
- think Postgres's JSON type - but they make no guarantees of being compatible
between different backends

== User Define Types

* https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html[You can build types!]

* Got a legacy DB that does some weird encoding on a text field? Well, just
  write a custom type that encodes-decodes to/from that field and you're good
  to go
